# File: setup_venv_instructions.txt
# Purpose: Create & configure virtual environment for Selenium automation framework

# Create Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv

# Allow PowerShell to Run Scripts in This Session
# This avoids the default execution policy block for scripts in Windows
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process

# Activate the Virtual Environment
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install Required Packages
pip install selenium requests urllib3 webdriver-manager pyautogui pynput html-testRunner importlib seletools

# Generate requirements.txt
# Use this PowerShell-safe command to export installed packages to requirements.txt:
pip freeze | Out-File -FilePath requirements.txt -Encoding ASCII

# Package Explanations
selenium            Automate browser actions for UI testing
requests            Simple HTTP requests for REST API testing
urllib3             Low-level HTTP library (used by requests internally)
webdriver-manager   Auto-downloads and manages browser drivers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
pyautogui           Automates keyboard/mouse actions outside browser scope (e.g., file uploads)
pynput              Captures keyboard/mouse input, useful for simulating complex user behavior
html-testRunner     Generates clean and readable HTML test reports for unittest-based test suites
importlib           Dynamically imports Python modules at runtime (e.g., for loading test modules by name)
seletools           Provides helper functions and utilities to simplify Selenium browser automation tasks
