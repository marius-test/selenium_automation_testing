# selenium_automation_testing

Target website: [https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/)

Built with **Python**, **Selenium WebDriver**, and the **unittest** framework, this project explores web automation challenges with a focus on problem-solving and test design.

Each feature pushes testing boundaries by requiring tricky element location, simulating user actions, or handling browser quirks, leading to both positive and negative test cases.

I chose `unittest` for its straightforward setup, native Python support, and focus on writing clear, maintainable tests.

The project includes a custom test runner, debug tools, and a reusable test template. Future plans include a custom reporter and more granular test control.

### Test Independence

Each test runs **independently**, creating and managing its own WebDriver instance without a shared driver factory. This supports stress-testing complex features by:

- Preventing shared state or test interference  
- Allowing any test order or parallel execution  
- Simplifying debugging by isolating failures  
- Trading speed for greater reliability and robustness
